# 🔍 IoT Security Scanner: Making Your Smart Home Less Dumb About Security!

## What is this magical tool?
Ever wonder if your smart toaster is secretly plotting world domination? The IoT Security Scanner is here to find out! This tool sniffs around your network, looking for IoT devices with questionable security practices (we're looking at you, webcam with the default password "admin123").

## 🚨 Features That Make Hackers Cry
- **Device Detective**: Finds all those sneaky IoT devices hiding on your network
- **Port Patrol**: Checks which doors your devices have left unlocked for visitors
- **Vulnerability Vigilante**: Identifies security issues faster than you can say "my refrigerator got hacked"
- **Risk Radar**: Tells you which devices to worry about first (spoiler: it's the one with Telnet enabled)

## 🛠️ Installation (So Easy Your Smart Speaker Could Do It)
```bash
# Clone this repo faster than your smart doorbell uploads footage to the cloud
git clone https://github.com/YashKantheti/simple-iot-scanner.git

# Enter the security zone
cd simple-iot-scanner

# Run with sudo because we're serious about security (and need those admin powers)
sudo python3 main.py
```

## 🏃‍♂️ One-Line Wonder (For the Impatient)
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YashKantheti/simple-iot-scanner/main/run.sh | bash
```

## 📊 Example Output (Names Changed to Protect the Vulnerable)
```

Your fridge is more open than your kitchen cabinet! It's running Telnet.
Maybe it's trying to call home about your midnight snacking habits?
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (When I'm Not Busy Securing My Own Toaster)
- Automatic firmware updating (because who actually does that manually?)
- Default password checking (no, "password123" is NOT secure)
- Fancy dashboard with blinky lights to impress your techie friends
- Integration with smart home systems ("Alexa, why are you talking to that server in Russia?")

## 🤓 Why I Made This
Because finding out your baby monitor is streaming to the public internet shouldn't be how you go viral.
